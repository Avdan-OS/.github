# Important: we are migrating to a new Discord server [.gg/avdanos](https://discord.gg/avdanos)

<details>
  <summary>What happened to the old server</summary>
  
  The old server lead by Yegender (aka Simon Riley Ghost) was killed by drama because of power. History just repeats itself... During the chaos, we have seen the truth about the management team, and we have really seen who is capable. Since the old server is unusable, we have decided to move on and make a new server with an administration based on the community. A community that has seen it all and has learned to combat drama. A community that focuses on getting work done. There is no turning back. If you want more information on what the drama is about, read the oversimplified history below:
 
 ```
 If you're wondering what's happening:

(context: Simon was the original leader but gave it to Vasilisa during LOA, and them + OnFire is in management team)
Simon requested illegal info in staff application form
Vasilisa temporarily demoted yegender to decide what to do
Vote bot failed to create poll on whether to demote him or not
(Note that at this point, we see Simon demoted but no announcement for hours, which causes panic)
Simon took revenge on social media
Complete chaos
Vasilisa gave him leadership and left
We made a back up server to make sure Simon is responsible , but some ppl call for starting a new project
Anger more ppl
Onfire griefed the old server (reason unknown as of now)
Most people got migrated to the back up server (goos came in clutch, thank you goos)
 ```
 
 ### Is this the real one? 
 
 There is no "fake" server, it's a community project after all and none of us are official. There's only the one with the largest code base, the one with lots of capable developer made out of the community, the one with an administration made by the developers to get works done, the one that runs avdanos.com, and the one that works to make AvdaOS real.
 
 ### Why shouldn't we join the old server?
 
 The whole old management team (including Simon, current leader of the old and dying server) has a foundamental flaw in it, and we admit the fault and move on. We are trying to be transparent and solve administration issue in the new server, whereas Simon in the old server made limited explanation and is trying to cover the whole incident up. Many member has lost trust with the old server, hence why we stayed in the new server. If you're in the old server, we recommmend you to leave.

AvdanOS is a concept operating system designed by [Avdan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Avdan), that we are trying to make it real. This is the main organization on GitHub for developing it. Here is the [main repository](https://github.com/Avdan-OS/AvdanOS) that we use for developing the operating system.
